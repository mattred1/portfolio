## Portfolio Site

A site built to house my portfolio, long-term (check out [mattredinger.com](https://www.mattredinger.com) or [mattred1.github.io/portfolio](https://mattred1.github.io/portfolio)). Once I have more projects, I'll add in an additional tab. In the meantime, I'll showcase what I'm learning here.




## To Do

- Organize/clean up SCSS file
- Fix coordination of nav/scrolled colors with dark/light mode
- Get extra Bootstrap src out
- Update navbar to transition colors
- Switch all JavaScript to jQuery
- Fix hr length overflowing, but keep them to look like stripes
- Consider adding fun transition/transform like [this](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/transitions-and-transforms) or [this](https://codepen.io/ImageHoverEffects/pen/GfJLg)



## What's used

- Mobile-first
